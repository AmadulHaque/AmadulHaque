### ➕ Optional: All Contributors Bot (badges + table)

1. Install the **All Contributors** GitHub App: [https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/installation](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/installation)
2. In an issue or PR comment, ask the bot to add someone:

   ```
   @all-contributors please add @username for code, doc
   ```
